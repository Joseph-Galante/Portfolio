                <p>" A curious tinkerer who works logically and efficiently, while maintaining a positive attitude. I enjoy taking on more challenging tasks in an effort to learn and sharpen my skills as quickly as possible. I take projects head on and with the confidence to exceed the projectâ€™s initial goals, with little to no extra guidance. I am passionate about working effectively with others while using standard practices to assure I am always providing clear and concise code. "</p>
