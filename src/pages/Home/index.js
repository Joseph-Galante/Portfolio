          " A curious tinkerer who works logically and efficiently, while
          maintaining a positive attitude. I enjoy taking on more challenging
          tasks in an effort to learn and sharpen my skills as quickly as
          possible. I take projects head on and with the confidence to exceed
          the projectâ€™s initial goals, with little to no extra guidance. I am
          passionate about working effectively with others while using standard
          practices to ensure I am always providing clear and concise code. "
